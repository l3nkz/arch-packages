Arch Linux Packages
===================

This repository contains all packages which I maintain for my Arch Linux box.
The resulting packages are then kept in a custom repository. See the 
[pacman wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman_tips#Custom_local_repository
"Pacman - custom local repository") for details how to set up such a repository.

Included Packages
=================

mutt-sidebar
------------
This package contains the console mail client [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/ "mutt") with
a partly self developed sidebar patch. This patch adds a sidebar to mutt showing your
mailboxes. This patch additionally adds proper support for folder indention and short
folder names in the sidebar.
