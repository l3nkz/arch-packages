Arch Linux Packages
===================

This repository contains all packages which I maintain for my Arch Linux box.
The resulting packages are then kept in a custom repository. See the 
[pacman wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman_tips#Custom_local_repository
"Pacman - custom local repository") for details how to set up such a repository.
